## Installation

#### Note: If you want to run the app locally you'll also need to have [the backend](https://github.com/speech-dismantler-5000/Google-Cloud-Speech-Node-Socket-Playground) running on your computer.

First you'll need the lastest version of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org).

Then the dependencies can be installed and the app can be run using:

``` console
npm install
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run lint <filename/folder>`

Runs EsLint for the specified file or folder. Lint errors will fail the build, so make sure they are fixed before pushing your changes.
